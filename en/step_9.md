## What next?

Here are some ideas for making the installation more permanent and protecting it from the elements. Whether you choose to follow them is up to you.

- If you're using the Gardman bird box, don't trust the keyhole mount on the back. This mount supports the entire weight of the bird box on a single thin piece of wood. It's better to drill through from the inside and mount it using a large screw and washer.

- Consider that the Raspberry Pi doesn't need to be directly attached to the bird box itself. You can buy a [replacement camera cable](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-camera-cable) which can give you greater range. The same connector found on the Raspberry Pi itself is also found on the back of the Camera Module, allowing you to change it easily; the tin connectors face the same side as the lens.

- The Raspberry Pi could be placed inside a plastic box to make it waterproof; it shouldn't be a problem to close the camera flex into the lid. Choosing a site which is beneath the overhang of an existing roof will help a lot, so the bird box will not be rained on directly.

- How will you get power and an internet connection to the bird box? You could use a wireless USB dongle but Ethernet is more reliable for streaming video, especially in built-up areas that have a lot of wireless traffic.

- Preventing water getting into the box should be a priority. The roof could be sealed using silicone sealant, which is often used to seal the edges of windows and bathroom sinks.

- Try to make use of the four mounting holes on the Camera Module. Perhaps you could jigsaw a wedge of wood to keep it at the right angle, and put screws through to hold it in place.

- What other uses can you think of for an infrared camera and LED?

- You could try following this [advanced worksheet](worksheet2.md) to stream your bird box live on the internet.
