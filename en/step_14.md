- First, you'll need to get the RealVNC server for your Raspberry Pi. You can download the **deb** package [here](https://github.com/RealVNC/raspi-preview/releases/download/5.3.1.18206/VNC-Server-5.3.1-raspi-alpha1.deb).

Running a computer without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse is often called running it headless, and uses a set of rules known as a communication protocol that allows two or more computers to communicate with each other. The two main protocols that you are likely to use to control your Raspberry Pi from another computer (such as your laptop, phone, or tablet) are VNC and SSH. 

VNC allows you to access the Raspberry Pi Desktop remotely, whereas SSH just allows you to access the command line. 

The easiest way to remotely access the Pi is to use VNC.
