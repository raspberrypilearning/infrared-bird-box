- On the left-hand side of the screen you should see a menu with the **My Channel** option available:

- Within the the **ENCODER SETUP** there is a **Server URL** and a **Stream name/key**. The key will appear to be just a line of asterisks, until you click on the **Reveal** button. You need to keep the key secret, though, so make sure you don't share it online.
