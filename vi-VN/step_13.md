## Remote control

The last thing you should consider is being able to access the Raspberry Pi remotely from another computer, without having to have a keyboard, mouse, and monitor connected to it. Having these attached would be pretty inconvenient if the Pi is located somewhere outside, like up a tree.

The easiest way to remotely access the Pi is to use VNC.
